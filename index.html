Hello everyone! Sorry about the sad look of the website at the moment, I will improve it soon.<br />
Last Updated Sept 28 2023 7:51 PM to add backing track for all white notes<br />
Backing tracks for improvising:<br />
One tip I have is to play above the middle of the piano. If you're familiar with middle C, play notes that are above it not below for best results.<br />
<a href="backingtrack.mp3">Black Key Backing Track</a><br />
<a href="WhiteNotesBackingTrack.mp3">White Key Backing Track (Any C, D, or E)</a><br />
<a href="AllWhiteNotesBackingTrack.mp3">White Key Backing Track (All white keys. Use this one if you learned about where F, G, A, & B are on the piano)</a><br />
Happy practicing!
